Hello, I'm Sablin Nikita. I'm currently a 4-th year student at 'National Research University of Electronic Technology' with future bachelor degree in 'Applied Math' field.
I enjoy working with computers, especially coding, System Administration and Arduino related stuff.
In addition to that I like riding a bicycle and travelling.

My biggest achievment so far is the App that house the Schulte Table Test and Gorbov Table Test
with local database of results and accounts.

Although this app was written for Microsoft Windows, I will rewrite it for GNU/Linux (the OS that I admire the most) using SFML library.

I consider myself the 'Jack of all trades' and I want to learn something new in different fields.
For now, I want to learn (in Addition to Python, C++ (most prefered), C) the following languages:
* Rust
* Java (or C#)
* Lua

and try out the Unreal Engine or Godot.

Future plans and/or projects:
* create music player for GNU/Linux that will play the soundcloud.com music
* create a library for mapping the Enum classes together (preferably at compile time, using constexpr or C++2x features)

As of the expectations for the course: I expect to learn something new that I might not know at the moment about curent business practices in programming field
and refresh my knowledge about C++ (maybe python).
